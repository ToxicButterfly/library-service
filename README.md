# library_service_api

**library_service_api** - this microservice is used for book management in a library.


**API documentation** [http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui/index.html)

I'm using Postgres database, and service pre-generates some tables for you in database **librarydb** so make sure that it's created.

To connect microservices "LIBRARIAN-SERVICE" and "LIBRARY-SERVICE" I use eureka server at Library-service-registry.
